Greetings, this is Circuit Breakers! We are seniors presently enrolled at the Brooklyn STEAM Center from various residential high schools. Working with several web frameworks and programming languages, such as HTML/CSS, Python, managing data using Python Notebooks, Vue, JavaScript, and Flask, has brought us all a long way. All of us Circuit Breakers have been busy writing our own projects! From constructing stopwatches and ToDo apps to making our own websites!
