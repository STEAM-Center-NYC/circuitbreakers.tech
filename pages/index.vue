            <p style="font-size: larger;">
              Welcome to a website made by one of the various pathways within the Brooklyn S.T.E.A.M Center! The S.T.E.A.M Center 
              is a CTE school that focuses on a variety of pathways and one of these pathways is Full-Stack Development. Our cohort, 
              Circuit Breakers, is a group of young and intelligent individuals who’ve all persevered through all the challenges that 
              programming has brought us to become experienced in a variety of skills; However, programming isn’t the only thing we study 
              within this pathway as its taught us to become better socializers and gain invaluable life skills that are used everyday within the workplace.

            <h2>What We Study</h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
              In Full-Stack Development, we study many programming languages such as HTML & CSS, Python, Javascript, and more! 
              We’ve also acquired multiple certifications like Python, HTML & CSS, and many others. On top of that, we also study 
              Post-Secondary options because it’s also important to consider what our choices will be past high school and how to manage 
              them.

            <h2>What We’ve Done</h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
              The curriculum of our Full-Stack Development class includes an array of different, enriching projects that are both fun and 
              satisfying to complete. Of this array, our most notable projects are our personal websites, our first Bootstrap websites, 
              and now this website you are looking at! During the development of this website, we put together two whole years of education, 
              hands-on experience, and teamwork to the test, and have since effectively shown our skills are something to be proud of!

            <h2>How the STEAM Center Has Affected Us</h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
              During our time here we've been able to accomplish many things, reach many goals, and forge our paths to our eventual 
              greatness! From assembling computers piece by piece to coding both the front and back end of our communal website, 
              it's safe to say that we’ve accumulated knowledge, experience, and resources that we would never be able to get otherwise. Ever since we arrived here, 
              we've been building upon our Agency, Social Capital, Competencies, Identity, and Equity, and every single one of us will be better off for it.
